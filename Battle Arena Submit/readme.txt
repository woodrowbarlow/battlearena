Battle Arena
By Banana Hive (Woodrow Barlow, Raymond Woods, Alex Bartell)

Awkward Battle Arena is a two-player fighting game featuring the Colour Crew. Each member of the
crew has different statistics and can utilize their weapons to different potentials.
Gameplay requires at least one XBOX 360 controller, the other player can use the keyboard
or another controller.

---Characters---

-Blue Jake-
Blue Jake is the feisty one of the bunch. Running track in Blue College, he is the fastest of the 
Colour Crew, but is rather unremarkable everywhere else.

-Violet Wendy-
Violet Wendy grew up a tomboy in a bad part of Colouria, so she quickly learned how to survive. 
Wendy takes less damage from enemies, but also moves more slowly than the rest.

-Red Scooter-
Red Scooter is your bubbly aunt that hasn't seen you in a few years. He takes a bit more damage
from enemies, but he can jump multiple times in mid-air. Try hitting the jump button many times!

-Green Kevin-
No one likes Green Kevin. Regardless, he's a little bit good at about everything, and even has
a second jump in mid-air.

---Controls---
				   Keyboard					Controller
				   --------					----------
Move  			-- WASD or Arrow Keys		Left Stick or D-Pad
